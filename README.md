# Data-visualization--R-programming-project.
Welcome to our project! We're working to make your air travel experience better. 
We use fancy computer tools to look at lots of data about how people feel when they fly. 
Things like comfy seats, cool movies, and nice service.
You can check out our computer code to see what we're doing and even help us make flying more awesome! 
Your input is super important.
